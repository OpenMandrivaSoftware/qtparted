Installation
------------

If this is a source package, then you need to compile.


Compiling
---------

Requirements:
  - Qt 3.1.0 multithreaded, nothing less!
  - libparted >= 1.6.6
  - header of libparted
  - (optional, for reiserfs) progsreiserfs >= 3.0.4
  - (optional, for ntfs) ntfsprogs 1.7.1 (tested only with this release)



NOTE ON QT 3.0 COMPATIBILITY:
QTParted can compile also with QT 3.0, just type "./configure --help" for
more information!


You can obtain Qt at http://www.trolltech.com/
If you use Debian just type:
apt-get install libqt3-mt-dev qt3-tools

If you want to install libparted and you use Debian testing/unstable i'm happy
to say that it exist also a deb of the libparted-dev :)

If you use another distribution... don't bother me but your mantainer! :)

To build QTParted, do:

  % ./configure
  % make

If you want to install QTParted in other path than /usr/local you must pass
some option to configure, like "./configure --prefix=/usr". For more information
about configure script type "./configure --help"

(Do not stop here.  Please read the rest of this file.)

Configure script has several options: the most useful are those that able to
change the path of external tools. For example if you want to change the path
of mkfs.ext3 just use "./configure --mkfs.ext3=/new/path/mkfs.ext3". I want
to underline that it is possible to change the path also when qtparted is
compiled, using the configuration dialog.

If you get an error running qmake, then you don't have a proper Qt3
development environment setup.  Please make sure you have Qt3 installed,
and direct any questions towards the package maintainer of wherever you
got Qt3.  Please don't ask me how to setup Qt3, I get enough mail already.

Now, if the compile fails, then you're allowed to email me :)

If you use Debian just try to export these before run qmake:
export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt
export QMAKESPEC=linux-g++

Notes about compiling:
    * QTParted is developed using g++ 3.2
      Actually it should compile fine also with the good old 2.95

    * When you compile the source you'll get a lot of warning about libparted,
      however using g++ 3.2 of Debian SID this doesn't happen... why?

    * QTParted is developed using QT 3.1.1, however i'm almost sure that
      it compile also under QT 3.0.3, 'cause when i started to develop it
      i used that release.


Alright, if the compile succeeded, you should have an executable called
"qtparted". Just run it (as root).

If you like it... just "make install" :)
