FAQ for DEVELOPERS
==================

[01]. How to compile sources ?
------------------------------
*) Run cmake . && make && make install
   Or, if you wish to customize settings,
   Run ccmake . && make && make install

[02]. How to make a new release ?
---------------------------------
1) Update several text files, located at the root of the sources:
   - ChangeLog: update the changes of the new release
   - qtparted.lsm: just change the version
   - CMakeLists.txt: just change the version
2) Get the last CVS version:
   cvs co <cvs-module-name>
   Don't keep your current CVS local version
   in order to remove trash/backup files
3) Create the administration files
   make -f Makefile.dist
4) Test and clean
   ./configure <your-options> && make && make install
   make distclean
5) Create the archive
   cd ..
   mv qtparted-cvs qtparted-x.y.z
   tar cfj qtparted-x.y.z.tar.bz2 qtparted-x.y.z
   try again to compile from files from the archive
6) Put a tag in CVS. Respect the syntax. Here is an example
   (dots "." are not allowed in a CVS tag, then we use "_")
   cd qtparted-cvs
   cvs tag TAG_20030401_RELEASE_0_4_0
   (Example for 1st-April-2003 - version 0.4.0)
7) Put the archive on sourceforge.net
8) Announce the version on the web site and on 
   http://www.freshmeat.net

[03]. How does the build system works ?
---------------------------------------
It's based on the official GNU autoconf/automake tools.
* Only configure.ac and Makefile.am matters
  Don't edit Makefile, Makefile.in, or the ./configure script
* configure.ac -----(autoconf)----> configure
  Makefile.am ------(automake)----> Makefile.in
  Makefile.in ------(configure)---> Makefile
  
[04]. What is the qttypes.h file ?
----------------------------------
One big proble with the C language, is that types can change.
For example sizeof(int)=4 somestimes, and 8 on another computer.
The ./configure creates this file, in order to provide constant
types. It was taken from the glib administration files.
For example u16 is always an "unsigned 16 bits integer", and
s32 is always an "signed 32 bits integer".
It matters when you save data inside a file.
