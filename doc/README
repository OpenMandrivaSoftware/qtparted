Description
-----------

  QTParted is a Partition Magic clone written in C++ using the Qt toolkit.
  I don't know if it exist some other software that do the same... i think
  that exist some commercial project, but i don't know any GPLed software!

  Of course you use this software AT YOUR OWN RISK!

  Plans for future version
   - btrfs support
   - badblocks check
   - Add jfs resize support
   - Code clean up of the SpinBox widget
   - Get rid of Q3 compat class usage
   - copy partition (not so trivial) :(
   - Bugfixes :-)
