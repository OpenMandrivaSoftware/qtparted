KNOW BUGS
---------

-. The Resize dialog is buggy when used in an extended partition. For example you can
   shrink it to zero byte... even if there are some logical partitions inside! Of course
   this is not a problem, 'cause libparted is not stupid and resize to the minimal size.
-. Another problem of the Resize dialog is that with some filesystem (and also with
   extended partitions) you can resize the partition on the left side.
-. You cannot choose "move" partition with ext2. I don't understand why, but libparted
   return a wrong value when i get ext2 info using ped_file_system_type_get_next. A
   solution could be made a workaround for ext2!
-. When you use the filesystem wrapper (for example you want to resize a NTFS partition)
   the ProgressBar dialog don't work.
-. The label entered in "create dialog" doesn't work. Actually it work only when you use
   it creating NTFS o JFS partitions.
